Workshops for Day 3 of the 2026 Winter School for AI in Predictive Agriculture @ UQ, Queensland AU.
Using DNA foundation models to inform SNP selection for genomic prediction tasks.

Created by Thomas Crow, Claire Huang and Dr David Kainer from the ARC CoE for Plant Success in Nature and Agriculture and the University of Queensland.

## Workshop Files

- `WinterSchool_2026_colab_notebook.ipynb`: The main workshop activity notebook. Designed to be run in Google Colab (in Jupyter/iPython format) to perform DNA foundation model tasks and downstream analysis.
- `Sbicolor_454_v3.0.1_Chr09.fa.gz`: Compressed reference genome FASTA file for *Sorghum bicolor* Chromosome 9, used during Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) validation.
- `data/Sorghum_bicolor.Sorghum_bicolor_NCBIv3.dna.chromosome.1.fa.gz`: Compressed reference genome FASTA file for *Sorghum bicolor* Chromosome 1, used as reference sequence data for Chromosome 1 SNPs.
- `data/panicle_length_genomatrix_snps.vcf`: A sorghum genotype matrix of 1000 SNPs across 527 accessions. SNPs match Chr9_random1000 SNPs.
- `data/pheno_PL_filtered.tsv`: Phenotype data for panicle length in sorghum across 527 accessions.
- `data/DS24-Chr9_random1000_maf05.tsv`: 1000 randomly selected SNPs from *Sorghum bicolor* chromosome 9.
- `data/sap_flowering.pheno`: Tab-separated values file containing phenotype data ("days to flowering") for the Sorghum Association Panel (SAP) population (Chromosome 1).
- `data/snp_matrix_1000.csv.gz`: Compressed CSV file containing a genotype matrix of 1,000 randomly selected SNPs from Chromosome 1. The accessions in this matrix correspond to those in `sap_flowering.pheno`.
- `data/sap_flowering_1000.vcf`: VCF genotype file containing the 1,000 selected Chromosome 1 SNPs.
- `data/260706_df_full_comparison.csv`: CSV file containing Plant Caduceus model inference scores (including embedding distance, expression score, and log-likelihood probability score along with ensemble ranks) for the 1,000 selected Chromosome 1 SNPs in `sap_flowering_1000.vcf`.
- `data/sap_flowering_alleles.tsv`: TSV file mapping each of the 1,000 Chromosome 1 SNPs to its exact reference genome allele and alternative allele.

## Sorghum bicolor Minimal Ensembl VEP (Chr09)

A minimal, offline setup of Ensembl Plant VEP (Variant Effect Predictor) tailored for predicting variant effects on **Chromosome 9** of *Sorghum bicolor*. Designed to be loaded and run in seconds inside Google Colab without overriding or breaking your existing Python/ML environment.

The codebase for this minimal setup is located in the [sorghum-vep-minimal/](sorghum-vep-minimal/) directory.

### Features
- **Ultra-fast setup**: Uses a standalone `micromamba` binary to install VEP and `htslib` into an isolated prefix. Takes ~60 seconds to set up.
- **Isolated environment**: Preserves Colab's default Python environment (including PyTorch, CUDA, and transformers).
- **Coordinate-aligned**: Automatically resolves naming mismatches between Ensembl GFF3 (which uses `9`) and Phytozome FASTA (which uses `Chr09`).
- **Python Integration**: Seamlessly write variant DataFrames to VCF, run VEP, and read predicted consequences back into Pandas DataFrames.

### Quick Start in Google Colab

Run the following cell to bootstrap the environment and download reference data.

#### 1. Installation & Setup
```bash
# 1. Clone this repository
!git clone https://github.com/scicrow/AI_WinterSchool_2026.git
%cd AI_WinterSchool_2026/sorghum-vep-minimal

# 2. Bootstrap the isolated VEP conda environment
!bash colab_bootstrap.sh

# 3. Download and filter Chr09 GFF3/FASTA files
!python prepare_data.py
```

#### 2. Running VEP from Python
Here is how you can integrate VEP into your python workflow:

```python
import pandas as pd
from vep_wrapper import write_snps_to_vcf, run_vep, load_vep_results

# Define some test SNPs on Chromosome 9
snps = [
    {"id": "test_snp_1", "pos": 12682424, "ref": "C", "alt": "G"},
    {"id": "test_snp_2", "pos": 25373090, "ref": "A", "alt": "G"}
]

# 1. Convert to VCF format
write_snps_to_vcf(snps, "input_variants.vcf")

# 2. Run VEP programmatically in offline mode
run_vep("input_variants.vcf", "vep_predictions.txt")

# 3. Load VEP predictions directly into a Pandas DataFrame
df_predictions = load_vep_results("vep_predictions.txt")
display(df_predictions.head())
```

---

### Local Installation

If running locally on a system with Conda/Mamba installed:

```bash
# Navigate to the tool directory
cd sorghum-vep-minimal

# Create the environment
conda env create -f environment.yml

# Activate the environment
conda activate sorghum-vep

# Download and index reference data
python prepare_data.py
```

### sorghum-vep-minimal Structure
- [environment.yml](sorghum-vep-minimal/environment.yml): Conda environment configuration.
- [colab_bootstrap.sh](sorghum-vep-minimal/colab_bootstrap.sh): Automates isolated conda setup in Colab.
- [prepare_data.py](sorghum-vep-minimal/prepare_data.py): Handles downloading, renaming, and indexing chromosome 9 files.
- [vep_wrapper.py](sorghum-vep-minimal/vep_wrapper.py): Provides Python APIs to generate VCFs, invoke VEP, and load predictions.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while running the workshop in Google Colab:

- **Strict Cell Execution Order**: Cells must be run in the exact order they appear. This is critical due to fragile installation and dependency alignment requirements, specifically involving `mamba_ssm` and `causal_conv1d`.
- **Session Reset**: If you run into import/library conflicts or unexpected errors, choose **Runtime > Disconnect and delete runtime** (or **Restart session**) from the Colab menu, then rerun the cells from the top.
- **Fresh Copy**: If problems persist after resetting, please discard your current session and open a fresh copy of the notebook (`WinterSchool_2026_colab_notebook.ipynb`).
